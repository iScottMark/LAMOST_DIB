# Diffuse Interstellar Bands in LAMOST


## Introduction

This code repository contains the tools and tutorials for measuring the Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) in the LAMOST spectra, which is linked to the paper [Ma et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...691A.282M/abstract) and [Ma et al. (2025)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025RAA....25i7001M/abstract).
